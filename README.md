# UIR6U CubeSat

This is a SDR-based amateur satellite project based on STM32H743VIT6 microcontroller. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- STM32CubeIDE for Visual Studio Code
- STM32CubeMX (optional, for peripheral configuration)

STM32CubeIDE is not required for this project.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/saurlax/uir6u-cubesat.git
```

Then open the project folder in VS Code, the extension should automatically detect the project and set up the environment.
